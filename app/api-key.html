<h2>API Key Required</h2>
<div>
        <p>Sorry, but you need to enter your API key to use Weather Underground.  Their service is great and I wouldn't want people to potentially abuse my API key (even accidentally).  This is a public <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository after all.  Sign up for yours at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/</a></p>
        <div api-key-collector></div>
        <p>This page uses local storage to preserve your API key.  If you see this page again, it means your API key was not entered correctly or perhaps it is no longer valid.</p>
