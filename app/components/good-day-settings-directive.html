<div>
    I feel that it is a good day when it is within <input type="number" min="0" max="10" ng-model="goodDaySettings.range" class="ml-1em mr-1em w-3em" /> degrees of <input type="number" min="32" max="108" ng-model="goodDaySettings.temp" class="ml-1em w-4em" />.<br />
    Put another way, that is from {{goodDaySettings.temp-goodDaySettings.range}} to {{goodDaySettings.temp+goodDaySettings.range}}&deg;F.
</div>
